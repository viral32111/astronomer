# Astronomer

This is a [GTK 3.0](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/) application for Linux that uses [NASA's APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html) to fetch and display real-time data.

The current plan is to implement the Astronomy Picture of the Day, the International Space Station's position, and Landsat imagery.

## Background

This project represents my first time creating GUI applications on Linux, previously all my GUI work has been on Windows in C# using the .NET Framework, or in C++ using various GUI libraries such as SFML. As mentioned, this is made using GTK, but I would like to try out Qt at some point in the future for another project as it is crossplatform.
